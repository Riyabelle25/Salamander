To test the code:


pip install -r requirements.txt


python manage.py runserver


go to localhost:8000

#### INSTALL A DRIVER (LocalHost)
If you are running your code on a localhost, then you'll need to install a chromedriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). Install and extract the chromedriver.exe file and save it in your project folder. Make sure to install the version that matches your Chrome version.
To check your chrome version, type ```chrome://version/``` in the chrome address bar.
